				<h3>Dr. Robert Pless</h3>
				<h4>Head Researcher and Chair of Computer Science @ GWU</h4>
				<a href="#">pless@gwu.edu</a>
				<a href="http://robertpless.com/">Website</a>
				<hr>
				<p> Dr. Robert Pless conducts research in the area of computer vision with applications to environmental science, medical imaging, robotics and virtual reality. He is particularly interested in studying data-driven and geometric techniques to more robustly
					understand images taken “in the wild.” This research exploits the fact that cameras are incredibly precise measurement systems: if they are calibrated properly, then the vast quantities of visual data they collect can help us learn, understand, and
					manipulate the world around us. At a high level, the current themes of research in his lab are: understanding visual change at scales from the sidewalk to the planet, studying next generation imaging systems for virtual reality and robotics, and
					democratizing visual analytics with applications to social justice.</p>
