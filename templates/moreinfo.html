<h3>Background</h3>
    <p>The Archive of Many Outdoor Scenes (AMOS) dataset contains 1,128,087,180 images taken from 29,945 webcams located around the world, the vast majority in the United States. Construction of AMOS began in March, 2006 and continues to this day. This dataset
      is unique in that it contains images from significantly more scenes than in previous work.</p>

    <p>
      The cameras in the dataset were selected by a group of graduate and undergraduate students using a standard web search engine. Images from each camera are captured several times per hour using a custom web crawler that ignores duplicate images and records
      the capture time. The images from all cameras are 24-bit JPEG files that vary in size. Most are 640 x 480 pixels, but some are at a much higher resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each image's capture time is recorded in the image's file name. We use the format yyyymmdd_hhmmss.jpg (4 digits for year, and 2 digits each for month, day, hour minute, and second), and the timestamp is in GMT.
    </p>
