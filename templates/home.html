		<h2>Welcome to AMOS, the Archive of Many Outdoor Scenes!</h2>
		<h3>{{camera_count}} Cameras and {{image_count}} Images Counting!</h3>
		<p>AMOS is a collection of long-term timelapse imagery from publicly accessible outdoor webcams around the world. We explore how to use these images to learn about the world around us, with a focus on understanding changes in natural environments and understanding
			how people use public spaces. To support these applications, we work on fundamental research in camera geolocation, camera calibration, camera registration to GIS data, and the automatic annotation of events and objects in a scene. The AMOS project
			began in March 2006 and is currently maintained at Washington University in St. Louis by Robert Pless and at the University of Kentucky by Nathan Jacobs. We encourage you to learn more about the AMOS dataset, project participants, and publications.
